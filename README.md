# Movie watch list

A CRUD web application for archiving movie selections

[Go to website](https://movie-watch-list-app.herokuapp.com)

I built this app to consolidate ruby on rails again and remind myself to build a MVC structure on my own from the scratch to the deployment. Also, I wanted to practice new CSS framework, TailwindCSS on this app, which I have never used before. All movies are generated by this [themoviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) call.

## Skills I used
Ruby on Rails, HTML, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku
